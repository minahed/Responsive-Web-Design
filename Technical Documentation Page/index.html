                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment
                <br>(for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to
                provide programmatic control over
                <br>them.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as
                <br>operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
                purposes by supplementing it with
                <br>additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object
                    <br>Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                    HTML form and respond
                    <br>to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server.
                    <br>For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
                    continuity of information
                    <br>from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java
                <br> but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java
                expression syntax, naming
                <br> conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from
                LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                runtime
                system based on a small
                <br>number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of
                <br>the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited
                <br>can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be
                <br>properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do <br>not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. <br>Variables, parameters, and function return
                types are not explicitly typed.
